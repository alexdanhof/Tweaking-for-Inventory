# My-Memory
When did I? Where did I put it? How long until?

I wanted a simple way to remember things using Alexa.  The skill uses a csv file hosted somewhere, to hold the information to be remembered. Personally, I saved the csv file in DropBox, which can easily be edited using a text editor.  The format is "keyword,description,date"
